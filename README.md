A)Look for the missing values in all the columns and either impute them (replace with mean,
median, or mode) or drop them. Justify your action for this task.


**Justificaion**

It is better to fill in missing values (impute) than to remove them (drop), because we can keep more data. However, imputing missing values can make the data biased, especially if the missing values are not spread out evenly.

Dropping missing values is easier, but it can lead to losing data. So, it is important to think about the specific situation before deciding whether to impute or drop missing values.

In the case of the used car dataset, I recommend imputing the missing values. This is because the dataset is relatively large and the missing values are not evenly distributed. Imputing the missing values will allow us to keep more data and get a more accurate picture of the relationship between the features and the price of the cars.
